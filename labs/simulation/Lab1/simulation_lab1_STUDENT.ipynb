One downside of a dict and a custom class is that they are both mutable (although a class can have custom properties where users can only 'viewable' attributes).  A dataclass can easily be made immutable and requires less code than a custom class, but has the downside that its syntax is a little less pythonic.

For example, as a patient completes a call we can calculate a running mean of waiting times and a running total of the operators are taking calls.

You could also use this approach to audit queue length where the queue length is recorded each time request for a resource is made (and/or when a resource is released).\n",

    "The second strategy to results collection is to store either a reference to an object (e.g. `Patient`) or a quantitative value (e.g. waiting time) during the run.  Once the run is complete you will need to include a procedure for computing the metric of interest.  **An advantage** of this strategy is that it is very simple, captures all data, and has minimal computational overhead during a model run!  **A potential disadvantage** is that for complex simulation you may end up storing a large amount of data in memory. In these circumstances, it may be worth exploring event driven strategies to reduce memory requirements.\n",
